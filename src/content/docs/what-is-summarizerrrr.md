## What is Summarizerrrr?

Summarizerrrr is a personal project I built when I couldn't find an extension that met my needs. With the help of AI, I created this tool and made it free and open source for everyone.

## Features

Summarizerrrr helps you summarize content from YouTube videos, Udemy & Coursera courses, web articles, or any text you highlight. It supports multiple AI providers including Gemini, ChatGPT, Groq, and DeepSeek — or run completely offline with Ollama and LM Studio.

## Customization

You can choose summary length, output language (40+ languages), write custom prompts, and personalize the interface with Dark/Light mode and various fonts.

## Privacy

The extension stores no data on external servers, has no tracking, and no analytics. Your API keys are stored locally on your device and are never sent anywhere except the provider you choose.

## Free & Open Source

Summarizerrrr is completely free and open source. You can view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/trongnguyen24/Summarizerrrr). You just need to provide your own API key — Gemini has a free tier, or you can run locally with Ollama without needing internet access.
